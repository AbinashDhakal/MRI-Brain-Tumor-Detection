# MRI Tumor Detection

Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a Tumor Detection system using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The goal is to leverage deep learning techniques to identify and localize tumors within MRI scans. The system is designed to aid medical professionals in the accurate and efficient diagnosis of potential tumors.

Features
Preprocessing: Includes data preprocessing steps to enhance the quality of MRI images and prepare them for the model.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Utilizes a CNN architecture for effective feature extraction and tumor classification.
Evaluation Metrics: Implements various metrics to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualization: Provides tools for visualizing the model predictions alongside the original MRI scans.
